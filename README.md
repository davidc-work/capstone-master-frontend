## About

The frontend of our Capstone project was built in Angular.  Among many of its most prominent features are the fact that it was styled almost entirely with custom CSS, using only <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ganlanyuan/tiny-slider">Tiny Slider</a> for charting and image carousels, respectively.  We also made use of <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">fontawesome's</a> API for icons, in some instances.

Great lengths were taken to ensure that the user experience was as straightforward and easy to understand as possible.  We also did our best to give the application a professional experience, while simultaneously keeping all functionality intact and as practical for use as we could.  In short, our philosophy was that performance would not be sacrificed for the sake of appearances.

Ultimately, we are all very proud of our final project.  Each member of the team put in a lot of time and effort to make our Capstone project what it is, and I believe it paid off very well.
